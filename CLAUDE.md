# CLAUDE.md

Per-repo orientation for `donaldgifford/sluice`. This file is a
Go-shaped overlay on top of the universal homelab `CLAUDE.md` (see
[homelab/docs](https://github.com/donaldgifford/docs)); the universals
apply here too — only Go-specific guidance is captured below.

## What this is

`sluice` is a Go binary maintained as part of the homelab fleet:

- Single binary under `cmd/sluice/`; library code under
  `internal/` (private to the module).
- Built into a distroless container via `Dockerfile`; released as
  multi-arch (linux+darwin × amd64+arm64) archives via `goreleaser`.
- Lives on Forgejo (`github.com/donaldgifford/sluice`); a
  `.github/workflows/` mirror exists so the repo can also build on
  GitHub once it's mirrored.

## Layout

```
cmd/sluice/    # main package — keep thin, parse flags + call into internal/
internal/               # library code; not importable outside this module
Dockerfile              # multi-stage distroless build, cached layers
.goreleaser.yml         # release config (multi-arch archives + checksums)
mise.toml               # pinned go + golangci-lint + goreleaser + universal tools
justfile                # `just` task runner — `just` for the menu
.forgejo/workflows/     # CI (Forgejo Actions) — primary
.github/workflows/      # CI (GitHub Actions) — mirror
```

## Workflows

### Build + run

- `just build` — `go build -o bin/sluice ./cmd/sluice`
- `just run -- <args>` — runs via `go run` without building
- `just test` — race detector + coverage to `coverage.txt`

### Lint + format

- `just lint` — `golangci-lint run` + yamllint + markdownlint + prettier
  (covers the universal linters too).
- `just fmt` — `go fmt ./...` + yamlfmt + prettier `--write`.

### Release

- `just release v0.1.0` — tag + push. CI picks up the `v*` tag and runs
  `goreleaser release --clean`, producing multi-arch archives and a
  release entry on Forgejo (via `GITEA_TOKEN`) or GitHub
  (via `GITHUB_TOKEN`).
- Version metadata is injected into the binary via `-ldflags`:
  `main.version`, `main.commit`, `main.date`. `--version`-style output
  should print these.

### Container build

Built locally with:

```
docker build -t sluice:dev \
  --build-arg VERSION=$(git describe --tags --always) \
  --build-arg COMMIT=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) \
  --build-arg DATE=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ) .
```

The Dockerfile uses BuildKit `--mount=type=cache` for `/go/pkg/mod` and
`/root/.cache/go-build` — first build is cold, subsequent builds reuse
the cache layers.

## Go-specific conventions

- **`go.mod` go directive matches `mise.toml`** (currently `go 1.26.5`).
  Bump both together — Renovate's Go updater handles `go.mod`; bump
  `mise.toml` in the same commit.
- **No `vendor/`**. Modules are resolved at build time; the Docker cache
  mount handles offline-ish builds.
- **`internal/` is a hard wall** — packages there can't be imported by
  other modules. Use it liberally; promote to a separate module only
  when something outside this repo actually needs it.
- **`slog` for structured logs**, not `log` or third-party loggers. Set
  the default handler in `main()` so library code doesn't have to
  thread loggers.
- **No `init()` for behavior**. `init()` runs at import time — it breaks
  test isolation and surprises future-you. Wire dependencies in `main()`.
- **Tests live next to the code** (`foo_test.go` alongside `foo.go`).
  Integration tests that need external services go under a `// +build
  integration` (or `//go:build integration`) tag and run via
  `go test -tags=integration ./...`.
- **Errors wrap with `%w`**: `fmt.Errorf("loading config: %w", err)`.
  Top of the call stack handles via `errors.Is` / `errors.As`.

## CI matrix

- `.forgejo/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every push/PR — `just test` + `just lint`.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` is the mirror; identical jobs, runs on the
  GitHub mirror if/when one exists.
- Release workflows fire only on `v*` tag push; `goreleaser` consumes
  `.goreleaser.yml` and the appropriate token (`GITEA_TOKEN` for
  Forgejo, `GITHUB_TOKEN` for GitHub).

## Gotchas

- **`go mod tidy` on first scaffold**: the post-create hook runs it
  automatically. If you skip hooks (`--no-hooks`), run it manually
  before the first `just build` or imports will be unresolved.
- **`goreleaser` v2 config**: the v1 → v2 migration moved
  `archives[].format` to `archives[].formats` (slice). If you copy a
  pre-v2 `.goreleaser.yml` from elsewhere, validate with
  `goreleaser check`.
- **Distroless `nonroot` UID is 65532**. If the binary needs to write
  state, mount a writable volume — the rootfs is read-only.
- **goreleaser + Forgejo**: the v6 action defaults to GitHub-shaped
  release URLs. The `gitea_urls` block in `.goreleaser.yml` is
  commented by default — uncomment for Forgejo releases, and ensure
  `GITEA_TOKEN` is set in repo Secrets (PAT with `write:repository`).

## Renovate

- `go.mod` updates are PR'd by Renovate's Go module manager.
- Container base images in `Dockerfile` are PR'd by the Docker manager.
- `mise.toml` versions are handled by a custom regex manager configured
  upstream in `donaldgifford/renovate-config`.
